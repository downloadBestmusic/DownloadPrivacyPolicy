<br><b>5. Who do we SHARE your personal data with?</b><br>
We may share your data with third parties, to help manage our business and deliver services. These third parties may from time to time need to have access to your personal data. These third parties may include: 
<br>Service providers, who perform functions on our behalf such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data (<b>such as Google Firebase, Microsoft Power BI, Facebook</b>), providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (<b>including paid listings and links</b>), processing credit card payments, providing translation services (<b>such as Baidu</b>) and providing customer services.

<br>Other third parties, for the purposes of detecting, preventing or otherwise addressing fraud, security or technical issues, protecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of our users or the public;
<br>Solicitors and other professional services firms (<b>including our auditors</b>).
<br>Also, if we were to sell part of our businesses we would need to transfer your personal data to the purchaser.
<br><b>6. Direct Marketing</b><br>
We may use your personal data to send you direct marketing communications about our products and services or our related services including our latest product announcements and upcoming events. This may be in the form of [email, post, SMS, telephone or targeted online advertisements]. We limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level, and to send you communications which we think will be interesting and relevant to you, based on the information we have about you.
<br>For the purposes of GDPR our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes is based on our legitimate interests, but where opt-in consent is required by the relevant European laws such as the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, we may ask you for your consent. You have a right to stop receiving direct marketing at any time. You can do this by following the opt-out links in electronic communications (<b>such as emails</b>), or by contacting us using the details in Section 12.
<br>We also use your personal data for customising or personalising ads, offers and content made available to you based on your usage of our mobile applications, websites, platforms or services, and analysing the performance of those ads, offers and content, as well as your interaction with them. We may also recommend content to you based on information we have collected about you and your viewing habits. This constitutes ‘profiling’ in respect of which more information is provided at Section 8 of this Policy.
<br><b>7. International Transfers</b><br>
We may share your personal data overseas, for example if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body. We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests:
<br>we will only transfer your personal data to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection; and
<br>to service providers and other third parties will always be protected by contractual commitments for additional security. For example, the EU – US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal data transferred to the US.
<br>You have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above. Contact us as set out in Section 12 if you would like further information or to request a copy where the safeguard is documented (<b>which may be redacted to ensure confidentiality</b>).
<br><b>8. Profiling</b><br>
‘Automated decision making’ refers to a decision which is taken though the automated processing of your personal data alone. This means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not involve any human intervention. As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision making. Not all profiling results in automated decision making, but it can do.
<br>If you are a consumer that has signed up to receive marketing updates, we may use profiling [to ensure that marketing materials are tailored to your preferences and to what we think you will be interested in.] This does not have any significant effect, or a legal effect on you. In certain circumstances it may be possible to infer certain information about you from the result of profiling, which may include special categories of data. We will not however conduct profiling based on your special categories of data unless we have obtained your explicit consent to do so.
<br>PLEASE NOTE: You have certain rights in respect of automated decision making, including profiling where that decision has significant effects on you, including where it produces a legal effect on you. See Section 10.
<br><b>9. How long do we keep your personal data?</b><br>
We will retain your personal data for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes listed in Section 4 of this Policy. In some circumstances we may retain your personal data for longer periods of time, for example where we are required to do so to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements.
<br>In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a possibility of legal action relating to your personal data or dealings. We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to records in our care. Where your personal data is no longer required we will ensure it is either securely deleted or stored in a way which means it will no longer be used by the business.
<br><b>10. What are your rights?</b><br>
You have a number of rights in relation to your personal data. In summary, you may request access to your data, rectification of any mistakes in our files, erasure of records where no longer required, restriction on the processing of your data, objection to the processing of your data, data portability and various information in relation to any automated decision making and profiling or the basis for international transfers. You also have the right to complain to your supervisory authority.
<br>Those underlined are defined in more detail as follows: 
<br>Access
<br>You can ask us to:
<br>Confirm whether we are processing your personal data; Give you a copy of that data; Provide you with other information about your personal data such as what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it abroad and how we protect it, how long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and whether we have carried out automated decision making or profiling, to the extent that information has not already been provided to you in this Policy.
<br>Rectification
<br>You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal data. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.
<br>Erasure
<br>You can ask us to erase your personal data, but only where: It is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or you have withdrawn your consent (<b>where the data processing was based on consent</b>); or following a successful right to object (<b>see ‘objection’ below</b>); or it has been processed unlawfully; or to comply with a legal obligation which Best Downloader Apps Studio is subject to.
<br>We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal data if the processing of your personal data is necessary: for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely circumstances where we would deny that request.
<br>Restriction
<br>You can ask us to restrict (<b>i.e. keep but not use</b>) your personal data, but only where: its accuracy is contested (<b>see ‘rectification’ below</b>), to allow us to verify its accuracy; or the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.
<br>We can continue to use your personal data following a request for restriction, where: we have your consent; or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
<br>Portability
<br>You can ask us to provide your personal data to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it ‘ported’ directly to another data controller, but in each case only where: the processing is based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and the processing is carried out by automated means. 
<br>Objection
<br>You can object to any processing of your personal data which has our ‘legitimate interests’ as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Once you have objected, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights.
<br>Automated Decision Making
<br>You can ask not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing, but only where that decision: produces legal effects concerning you (<b>such as the rejection of a claim</b>); or otherwise significantly affects you.
<br>In such situations, you can obtain human intervention in the decision making, and we will ensure measures are in place to allow you to express your point of view, and/or contest the automated decision. Your right to obtain human intervention or to contest a decision does not apply where the decision which is made following automated decision making: is necessary for entering into or performing a contract with you; or is authorised by law and there are suitable safeguards for your rights and freedoms; or is based on your explicit consent.
<br>To exercise your rights you may contact us as set out in Section 
<br><b>11. PLEASE NOTE the following if you do wish to exercise these rights:</b><br>
Identity. We take the confidentiality of all records containing personal data seriously, and reserve the right to ask you for proof of your identity if you make a request.
<br>Fees. We will not ask for a fee to exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data, unless your request for access to information is unfounded, repetitive or excessive, in which case we will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances. We will let you know of any charges before completing your request.
<br>Timescales. We aim to respond to any valid requests within one month unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we aim to respond within three months. We will let you know if we are going to take longer than one month. We might ask you if you can help by telling us what exactly you want to receive or are concerned about. This will help us to action your request more quickly.
<br>Exemptions. Local laws may provide additional exemptions, e.g. in the UK, where it is subject to legal privilege, the right of access to personal data can be withheld from you in certain circumstances.
<br>Third Party Rights. We do not have to comply with a request where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other Data Subjects.
<br><b>12. How we PROTECT your personal data?</b><br>
We endeavour to protect us and you from unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data that we hold.
<br>In particular:
<br>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems;
<br>We use encryption where appropriate;
